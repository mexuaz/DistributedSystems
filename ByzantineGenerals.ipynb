    "Group of generals, each commanding a portion of the Byzantine army, encircle a city. These generals wish to formulate a plan for attacking the city. In its simplest form, the generals must decide only whether to attack or retreat. The important thing is that every general agree on a common decision, for a halfhearted attack by a few generals would become a rout, and would be worse than either a coordinated attack or a coordinated retreat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the generals might be treacherous who may not only cast a vote for a suboptimal strategy, they may do so selectively. For instance, if nine generals are voting, four of whom support attacking while four others are in favor of retreat, the ninth general may send a vote of retreat to those generals in favor of retreat, and a vote of attack to the rest.\n",
    " \n",
    "And since some of the generals are physically separated and having to send their votes via messengers who may fail to deliver votes or may forge false votes.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Byzantine fault tolerance can be achieved if the loyal (non-faulty) generals have a majority agreement on their strategy. There can be a default vote value given to missing messages. For example, missing messages can be given the value Null. Further, if the agreement is that the Null votes are in the majority, a pre-assigned default strategy can be used (e.g., retreat)."
